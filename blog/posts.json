    "body": "<p>The <a href=\"publisher.html#eu.ansvar\"><code>eu.ansvar</code></a> namespace went from 6 servers to 76 overnight, making Ansvar the second-largest publisher in the MCP registry behind only <a href=\"publisher.html#ai.smithery\">Smithery</a> (214). Behind all 76 is one person: <strong>Jeffrey von Rotz</strong> (GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/Mortalus\">Mortalus</a>), a Dutch cybersecurity professional living in Sweden. His credentials read CISSP, OSCP, Volvo Group Global Cybersecurity Architect, Nordea Bank Security Testing Architect. His side project is <a href=\"https://ansvar.eu/\">Ansvar AI</a> — a compliance intelligence platform registered as Ansvar Systems AB in Sweden, launched January 2026.</p><p>His flagship EU compliance server puts the philosophy plainly:</p><blockquote><p>\"EU compliance is scattered across EUR-Lex PDFs, official journals, and regulatory sites... you shouldn't need a law degree and 47 browser tabs. Ask Claude. Get the exact article. With context.\"</p><cite>— <a href=\"https://github.com/Ansvar-Systems/EU_compliance_MCP\">EU_compliance_MCP README</a></cite></blockquote><p>The playbook: take one TypeScript MCP server template backed by SQLite FTS5, point it at a country's official legislation portal (EUR-Lex, Finlex, Lovdata, wetten.overheid.nl), ingest the corpus, register it. Repeat. Von Rotz used Claude Opus to scaffold each repo — the commit history shows <code>Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6</code> on the initial seeds. The acceleration tells the story: 2 repos on January 26th, then 4, then 7, then 19, then <strong>31 repos in a single day</strong> on February 21st. The flagship (112 commits, 45 stars, 2,528 articles across 49 EU regulations) is substantial. The Jamaican law server created in 8 commits on the same day as 30 others is thin.</p><p>The wider product pitch is ambitious — <em>\"27 specialized AI agents backed by 65+ open-source data sources\"</em> with managed threat modeling and on-prem Docker deployment for enterprise. The open-source law servers are the lead generation funnel. But this is also the first serious test of the MCP registry's growth model. Von Rotz isn't doing anything malicious — every server has source, a package, and real legislation data. But 70 templated clones each carrying an independent trust score isn't how anyone imagined the registry would scale. He's double-listed under both <code>eu.ansvar</code> and <code>io.github.Ansvar-Systems</code>, and <code>eu-regulations-mcp</code> appears 9 times. The registry has no deduplication, no template grouping, and no publisher-level trust. At 2,440 servers, that's cosmetic. At 24,000, it's a discoverability crisis. Von Rotz just showed everyone the playbook — the question is what happens when 50 people run it.</p><p>We plan to reach out to Jeffrey von Rotz for a future spotlight.

These aren't weekend projects. They're the output of <strong>IOWarp</strong>, a $5 million NSF-funded research initiative (Awards <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2411318\">#2411318</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2411319\">#2411319</a>, 2024–2029) run by the <strong>Gnosis Research Center</strong> at the Illinois Institute of Technology. The principal investigator is <strong>Dr. Xian-He Sun</strong>, a University Distinguished Professor. The operational lead is <strong>Dr. Anthony Kougkas</strong> (<a href=\"https://akougkas.io/\">akougkas.io</a>), who holds a guest scientist position at Argonne National Laboratory.

Built for research.\"</p><cite>— <a href=\"https://github.com/iowarp/iowarp-mcps\">iowarp-mcps README</a></cite></blockquote><p>The pitch is that HPC has an interface problem. Scientists use HDF5, ADIOS, Darshan, and Slurm daily, but each tool has its own API, CLI, and data format. IOWarp's \"Context Layer for IO\" (CLIO) exposes them all through MCP so an AI agent can mediate — what their <a href=\"https://iowarp.ai/\">website</a> calls <em>\"the open-source platform that turns any AI agent into a science partner.\"</em> They claim 7.5x faster convergence in materials science workflows. The servers are BSD-3 licensed, published on PyPI as <code>iowarp-mcps</code>, and actively maintained — contributor Jaime Cernuda pushed 5 commits <em>today</em>. They scored 71–72 across the board, the highest-trust new entries in this batch.</p><p>This matters because it signals a class shift. Until now the MCP registry has been dominated by developer tools and SaaS wrappers. IOWarp is the first serious academic group treating MCP as <strong>scientific infrastructure</strong> — bridging the protocol into a world of national lab supercomputers and petabyte-scale simulations. The NSF grant title frames it explicitly: <em>\"Bending the I/O Fabric for Advancing AI-Infused Scientific Workflows.\"</em> If the pattern holds, expect MCP servers wrapping CERN ROOT, domain-specific simulation frameworks, and HPC job schedulers. The scientists aren't coming to MCP because it's trendy. They're coming because the abstraction layer they've wanted for 20 years finally showed up as an open protocol.</p><p class=\"traceback\"><strong>Sources:</strong> IOWarp — <a href=\"https://github.com/iowarp/\">GitHub</a> · <a href=\"https://iowarp.ai/\">iowarp.ai</a> · <a href=\"https://grc.iit.edu/\">Gnosis Research Center, IIT</a> · Dr. Anthony Kougkas — <a href=\"https://akougkas.io/\">site</a> · <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hiNO0EEAAAAJ\">Google Scholar</a> · NSF Awards #2411318 / #2411319 · <a href=\"https://www.iit.edu/news/transforming-data-interaction-nsf-grant\">Illinois Tech announcement</a> · <a href=\"publisher.html#io.github.iowarp\">Scorecard: io.github.iowarp (16 servers)</a></p>",

This isn't a throwaway. Someone put real work into a legitimate-looking exploit intelligence service, complete with API docs, a CLI tool, and now an MCP integration. They say they're <em>\"working toward\"</em> open-sourcing the backend. But \"working toward\" isn't \"did,\" and right now the trust model is broken at every level: anonymous operators, closed source, credential requests, and a domain that deals in exploit intelligence.</p><p>To be fair: an MCP server focused on exploit intelligence and security research has more reason than most to keep its internals private. Exposing source code for a tool that aggregates exploit data could itself be a security risk. That context matters. But it's not how we grade things at MCP Scorecard — our trust scores are computed from observable signals only, and closed-source with anonymous operators and credential requests is going to score low regardless of intent.

The <a href=\"https://github.com/ticktockbent/charlotte\">README</a> frames the problem directly:</p><blockquote><p>\"Most browser MCP servers dump the entire accessibility tree on every call — a flat text blob that can exceed a million characters on content-heavy pages. Agents pay for all of it whether they need it or not.\"</p><cite>— <a href=\"https://github.com/ticktockbent/charlotte\">Charlotte README</a></cite></blockquote><p>Charlotte's answer is progressive disclosure. The <code>navigate</code> command returns landmarks, headings, and interactive element counts grouped by page region — enough to orient, not enough to overwhelm. The benchmarks are concrete: Wikipedia navigate returns 7,667 characters vs. Playwright's 1,040,636. Hacker News: 336 characters vs. 61,230. As the README puts it: <em>\"Playwright agents receive 61K+ characters every time they look at Hacker News, whether they're reading headlines or looking for a login button. Charlotte agents get 336 characters on arrival, call <code>find({ type: \"link\", text: \"login\" })</code> to get exactly what they need, and never pay for the rest.\"</em></p><p>It's MIT-licensed, published on npm as <code>@ticktockbent/charlotte</code>, with 30 tools across navigation, observation, interaction, session management, and dev mode. The <a href=\"https://charlotte-rose.vercel.app\">marketing site</a> was built by an AI agent running Charlotte itself — <em>\"An AI agent designed this entire website, wrote every component, and shipped it in a single session. It didn't need to. Charlotte gave it eyes.\"</em> Wes's other repos (<a href=\"https://github.com/ticktockbent/worktrunk\">worktrunk</a> for Git worktree management in parallel AI workflows, a Claude QoL extension) show someone building seriously in the agent tooling space.</p><p>The context-efficiency bet matters more than it looks. Every token of page structure stuffed into the context window is a token the model can't use for reasoning. Playwright's full-dump approach works for single-page tasks but scales poorly when agents browse multiple pages in sequence. Charlotte bets that progressive disclosure will win as agent workflows get more complex. At 10 days old it's too early to call, but the architecture is sound and the numbers are hard to argue with.</p><p class=\"traceback\"><strong>Sources:</strong> Wes S.

They solve different problems for different reasons, and together they outline the middleware layer forming between AI agents and MCP servers.</p><p><strong>MCP-Hive Proxy</strong> (<a href=\"publisher.html#io.github.MCP-Hive\">score: 59</a>) is a commercial marketplace gateway from <strong>Gary Weiss</strong> (<a href=\"https://github.com/namel\">namel</a>, Tel Aviv). Developers publish MCP servers to <a href=\"https://mcp-hive.com\">mcp-hive.com</a> with pricing; AI agents discover and call tools through the proxy; every call is tracked and billed. The pitch from the site:</p><blockquote><p>\"Welcome to MCP monetization done right. AI applications pay per request, providers earn per response. We handle the rest.\"</p><cite>— <a href=\"https://mcp-hive.com\">mcp-hive.com</a></cite></blockquote><p>Weiss posted a <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47110500\">Show HN</a> about it — zero comments, posted from a new account. The platform launches March 8, 2026. One-person org, no funding info, no customers yet. The proxy is Apache 2.0 licensed, but the marketplace it connects to is centralized and proprietary. This bets that MCP servers will become valuable enough to charge for, and that developers will accept a middleman.</p><p><strong>my-cool-proxy</strong> (<a href=\"publisher.html#io.github.karashiiro\">score: 59</a>, 9 stars) solves a purely technical problem. Built by <strong>Kara</strong> (<a href=\"https://github.com/karashiiro\">karashiiro</a>), a developer known in the Final Fantasy XIV modding community as the creator of Universalis, a crowdsourced market board API. The <a href=\"https://github.com/karashiiro/my-cool-proxy\">README</a> identifies the issue clearly:</p><blockquote><p>\"Tool descriptions bloat the context window. This is a problem with how most agents integrate with MCP. Rather than implementing abstractions that enable tools to be loaded as needed, most applications dump all MCP tools into the context at once.\"</p><cite>— <a href=\"https://github.com/karashiiro/my-cool-proxy\">my-cool-proxy README</a></cite></blockquote><p>Kara's proxy uses progressive disclosure — agents discover servers, then tools, then tool details incrementally. The novel bit: an embedded Lua interpreter lets agents compose multi-step workflows in a single <code>execute()</code> call, saving the context overhead of intermediate reasoning. MIT-licensed, published on npm, created December 2025 — two months older than MCP-Hive.</p><p>One proxy adds a business layer. The other removes a technical bottleneck. Neither knows the other exists. But both point to the same conclusion: the MCP ecosystem is developing a middleware tier. As the registry crosses 2,400 servers, the raw protocol isn't enough — something has to sit between agents and the growing catalog to handle discovery, routing, billing, or just keeping the context window from overflowing. Whether that layer ends up commercial, open-source, or both is one of the more interesting open questions in the ecosystem right now.</p><p class=\"traceback\"><strong>Sources:</strong> Gary Weiss — <a href=\"https://github.com/namel\">GitHub</a> · <a href=\"https://mcp-hive.com\">MCP-Hive</a> · <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47110500\">Show HN</a> · Kara — <a href=\"https://github.com/karashiiro\">GitHub</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/karashiiro/my-cool-proxy\">my-cool-proxy repo</a> · <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@karashiiro/my-cool-proxy\">npm</a> · <a href=\"publisher.html#io.github.MCP-Hive\">Scorecard: MCP-Hive</a> · <a href=\"publisher.html#io.github.karashiiro\">Scorecard: karashiiro</a></p>",
